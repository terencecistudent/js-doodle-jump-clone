## Cloning and Pushing To The Respository
### Cloning:
- Here is a link how to clone a repository: 
https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

### Pushing To The Respository:
- To add, commit and push files to the repository, e.g. index.html, open a New Terminal and type:
1. git add index.html
2. git commit -m "Leave a message here"
3. git push origin master - (which is for the master branch).

- To create a new branch within your current application, open a New Terminal:
1. Create a branch: git checkout -b new-branch-name
2. Edit, add to your application and commit the files.
3. Push the branch to the remote repository: git push origin new-branch-name.

## Bugs and Fixes
1. A small error which I see when playing the game is that when the doodler is coming off from either the right or left sides of the grid, it would tend to glitch a little bit.

## RoadMap
In the future, I would like to implement:
1. Add a start/reset button when the game is over.
2. Let the user select the difficulty of the game e.g. move platforms faster.
3. Create additional creatures or bonus items to help the doodler or end the game.
